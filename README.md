 ## Description
 The purpose of this project was to build a back end application that could organize and store e-commerce data in a MySql database using sequelize. The user can test out the functionality of the application by using Insomnia Core to view tables, create new values to add to the tables, update values, and delete values from the tables. T The motivation behind this project was to gain greater familiarity with sequelize since some e-commerce sites utilize object relational mappers (ORM) such as sequelize to organize their data. This project has taught me how to organize data in databases such as Mysql using an ORM.

## Installation
To properly run this application, clone a copy of the repository from GitHub. Install inquirer by typing "npm install inqurier@8.2.4". Install mysql as well. Open MySql using the MySql shell, and create a database called "ecommerce_db". Exit out of the Mysql shell, and run "npm run seed" in the CLI to seed the database with values. Next, run node server.js to connect to the server. Open up Insomnia Core and create requests to view, create, update, or delete values from the tables.
